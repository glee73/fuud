1) How might a non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility
(that isn’t already discussed above)?

Making a site more accessible benefits everyone. Even a non-impaired person will benefit from the
increase readability, better design, etc. aspects of an accessible interface. Additionally, increased web
accessibility means that it can be accessed by more people, which benefits everyone. Perhaps a non-impaired user
will want to share a site with an impaired user


2) What are three design choices that User Inyerface made that harmed your user experience?
Explain how you would alter each design choice to improve accessibility and usability.

        1. Unnecessary moving/changing buttons. For example the 1, 2, 3, 4, blinking for no reason
and a profile picture icon had a loading sign. Unnecessary moving or blinking parts of the website
are distracting and should only be used to emphasize important information. To improve usability I would remove
these features.
        2. The Next button was on the left hand side, this was very unintuitive. To improve usability
I would move this to the right hand side (as this follows a more natural flow).
        3. Buttons/choices that prevent further action are usually the default selection in User Inyerface.
For example, to start filling in the form, a giant NO button is the first option presented. A giant cancel button
is also bolded at the bottom of the screen for the entire form process. I do NOT accept the terms and conditions
is the default. To improve usability, I would reverse these decisions, so that actions that encourage users
to progress through the form are the default selections.


3) What are three changes you made to your site to increase your Lighthouse (or other) audit score?
Explain how each change increases your site’s performance or accessibility.

        1. I added a black textbox around the words so that there was a greater contrast between
the text and background image. This improved aspects of readability.
        2. Increased overall font size, which again improved readability.
        3. Increased size of the submit button. This helps for users with poor fine-motor skills
and overall makes it easier to search for stars!
