1) We collect data regarding a user's Name, location, and timestamp for a checkin.
Each data point is needed so that we know the time and place of a user's checkin.
The name of a user is the relevant identifier for a user's identity, which is needed
to confirm who checked in. The location of the user is relevant so that our maps
application can use your location data to, for instance, give you directions on how
to get from your current location to another given location. Lastly, the timestamp of your
checkin is relevant so that we can estimate what time approximately you will arrive at your
destination.


2) It can be difficult to delete all of the data on a user because oftentimes it is
intertwined with other user's data. Take facebook for instance, say I made a post
and all my friends commented on it and liked it. If I want all of my data deleted,
it's not clear what happens to the post that I previously made. While I may have been
the original poster, that post contains information in the form of my friends' comments
and likes, and my friends might want their comment and like data preserved. But if my post
gets deleted, what happens to this info which wasn't mine but was intertwined and linked
to my data? This is an example of why it may be difficult to delete all of the data on a user,
especially on more complex applications.
