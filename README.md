**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 1)_
### Idea 1 - Restaurant Social Network


### Idea 2 - AI/ML Game Competition
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have gained prominence in recent years not just for their increased use in industry, but their larger place in popular knowledge and culture. We propose created a platform on which users can learn fundamental artificial intelligence methods and algorithms in the context of building bots that can play one or more games (such as connect4, checkers, chess, etc.), and then competing against other users in those games. For users that are just getting into coding, we could offer an experience where they assemple different pieces and tune parameters to build their algorithm, while more experienced programmers could write their own code but take advantage of our platform for fun and for experimenting with different ideas.

We would need to include the following featues:
* *Integration and Ability to Play Multiple Games* - for variety purposes, we would want our bots to be able to complete in more than one game. We would have to set up basic engines to run all games theat we want to include, and build the infrastructure to be able to connect in AI players. This might be challenging because of the 


### Idea 3 - Spotify
Especially during COVID, people have been looking for ways to connect. Spotify's
community page has a lot of people requesting more social-media-like
features, so we thought it would be a good idea to create a social network
based off of Spotify data and make the listening experience more
interactive. This would have to be a separate web-app where each profile
displays a user's top genres/songs/playlists and users can interact with each
other to recommend songs and create playlists off of those recommendations.

The following features would be necessary:
* *Integration with Spotify Web API* - this allows the webapp to access user data
  so that a users' top genres/songs/playlists can be shown on their profile;
  this way, a web player could also be embedded. We anticipate that learning
  to use the Spotify Web API and querying the data will be the most challenging
  part of this feature. Ideally, any playlists created on this app would also
  appear in a user's Spotify library.
* *An accessible user interface with a backend database of users* - as this is a
  social app, it definitely needs to be fun and intuitive to use. The front end
  can be challenging depending on how many features we want to implement, and
  the backend complexity would depend on whether we want our app to scalable.
* *Music recommender* - if we want to create playlists off of the recommendations,
  we probably need to implement a few algorithms. A few that Spotify already 
  uses includes collaborative filtering, natural language processing, and 
  convolutional neural networks. This part would be the hardest to implement
  because we might not have the depth of knowledge in ML needed.

### Idea 4


**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings
_On your first meeting with your mentor TA, you should plan dates for at least the following meetings:_

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 15)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 5)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 12 once you are assigned an adversary TA)_

## How to Build and Run
_A necessary part of any README!_
