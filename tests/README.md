# System Tests

All system tests should be stored in this directory. Please keep the tests you write separate from TA provided tests.

Using the smallMaps as well as the maps sqlite databases, we
have extensive error checking as well as functionality for the 
commands that have been added in maps.

All of the TA's original tests for maps12 can be found in the maps12 folder.
Our own tests can be found in the maps12test folder.

System tests from the stars portion of the project can be found
in src/test/system.
